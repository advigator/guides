The main image has the goal of winning the click from search results. It impacts click-through rate (CTR), or the percentage of daily traffic you capture.

The product has to cover 85% of available space on a pure white background. Recommended size is 1500x1500px and 10px white border. The image must not contain gratuitous or additional objects (like logo or watermarks) that may confuse the customer.


## Particular cases

We used our free Chrome extension to explore how some brands use the main photo to differentiate themselves from competitors. 
Your product may not fit the examples below but could be interesting for inspiration.

### Variation 
Protein’s grams and flavor are important features for this market niche, so they could be highlighted with a virtual label on the page. Ideally, you’ll want a packaging already designed and optimized for Amazon photos.

<table>
    <tr style="background-color: white;">
        <td style="background-color: #D3D3D3;">{{< figure src="proteins/61FEFqoA6CL.jpg" type="jpg"  >}}</td>
        <td>{{< figure src="proteins/41dkWtPWnaL.jpg" type="jpg"  >}}</td>
        <td>{{< figure src="proteins/41HsNEhvHsS.jpeg" type="jpg"  >}}</td>
        <td>{{< figure src="proteins/41xVz-zJQpL.jpg" type="jpg"  >}}</td>
        <td>{{< figure src="proteins/51fuajyP2+L.jpg" type="jpg"  >}}</td>
    </tr>
</table>

### Product in action
Sometimes showing the product as it is may wonder the customer about what it actually is. For this reason, you might provide the context in which it can be used. Always be sure not to confuse customers by making them believe that you are selling other products. In these cases, it is visually clear that the phone is not included in the package. You could also blur the context in the background.

<table>
    <tr style="background-color: white;">
        <td width="300px">{{< figure src="action/31L3iDPWPcL.jpg" type="jpg"  >}}</td>
        <td width="300px">{{< figure src="action/41QebeIBc7L.jpg" type="jpg"  >}}</td>
        <td width="300px">{{< figure src="action/51OupACFXBL.jpg" type="jpg"  >}}</td>
    </tr>
</table>

### Transparent container
If the product is a transparent container, it could make sense to fill it with something inside or with a color. This gives the customer context about what it actually is.

<table>
    <tr style="background-color: white;">
        <td>{{< figure src="colors/41xQlWkNtEL.jpg" type="jpg"  >}}</td>
        <td style="background-color: #D3D3D3;">{{< figure src="colors/51iC2VY6--L.jpg" type="jpg"  >}}</td>
        <td  style="background-color: #D3D3D3;">{{< figure src="colors/51RxOKfke7L.jpg" type="jpg"  >}}</td>
        <td  style="background-color: #D3D3D3;">{{< figure src="colors/51tLrXRRAyL.jpg" type="jpg"  >}}</td>
        <td  style="background-color: #D3D3D3;">{{< figure src="colors/91Lro6EFZDL.jpg" type="jpg"  >}}</td>
    </tr>
</table>

### Background
A pure white background is recommended in most cases. Comparing this product with its competitors you will immediately see that the others look more professional. Moreover, the sea in the background does not add information.

<table>
    <tr style="background-color: white;">
        <td width="20%">{{< figure src="background/71MEqmiAIiL.jpg" type="jpg" >}}</td>
        <td width="20%" style="background-color: #D3D3D3;">{{< figure src="background/21l-zG4MEfL.jpg"type="jpg"  >}}</td>
        <td width="20%" style="background-color: #D3D3D3;">{{< figure src="background/21xlvaofDiL.jpg"type="jpg"  >}}</td>
        <td width="20%" style="background-color: #D3D3D3;">{{< figure src="background/31xNv8rNlRL.jpg"type="jpg"  >}}</td>
        <td width="20%" style="background-color: #D3D3D3;">{{< figure src="background/3178RR3XouL.jpg"type="jpg"  >}}</td>
    </tr>
</table>

### Opaque background
Making the background opaque provides the context in which the product can be used but without distracting with other elements.

<table>
    <tr style="background-color: white;">
        <td style="background-color: #D3D3D3;">{{< figure src="opacity/41t3DjarcHL.jpg" caption="It provides context without distracting." type="jpg" >}}</td>
        <td>{{< figure src="opacity/41SglJVyA4L.jpg" caption="The background prevails over product." type="jpg" >}}</td>
        <td>{{< figure src="opacity/61pfO3ca9uL.jpg" caption="It is not immediately clear what it is for." type="jpg" >}}</td>
    </tr>
</table>
