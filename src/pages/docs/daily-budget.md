description: How to set a daily budget for a product
---

The daily budget in Advigator is chosen at the campaign group level. Advigator will efficiently distribute it to the sub campaigns.

---

We recommend starting with what you are already used to spending on that product. If the product is new $5-30 per day should be enough.

Given a Target ACoS, the daily budget may not be enough to keep campaigns active for the entire day. In such case, you will see a warning alert like this: 

![Out of budget](/images/budget/out-of-budget.png)

You will see a suggestion of the recommended budget and an estimate of the additional clicks you might get in a week.
Increasing the daily budget does not increase the bids per click, so it allows you to get more clicks on the page at about the same unit cost (CPC).

Reduce the target ACoS if you want to keep campaigns enabled all day long, but don't want to increase the budget. This will reduce the bids per click. You will get less visibility and at lower cost per click (CPC).

## Unspent budget

The ACoS target you choose constrains the budget that is actually consumed. 

If you choose a low ACoS target and a very high budget you may not see the entire budget consumed because bids per click are low. Note that Advigator calculates bids per click based on target acos and not based on daily budget.

If you want to spend the entire budget then slowly increase the target ACoS each day until you see that it is all spent for the entire day.

## Monthly budget

If you go to Account > Portfolio you can choose a total budget for the entire month for the entire marketplace. 
If in the middle of the month the total spent reaches this amount the campaigns are automatically stopped (enabled but stopped) by Amazon and will restart on the 1st first of the following month.
