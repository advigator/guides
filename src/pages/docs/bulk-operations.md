## Enabling all products in a category

1. Choose products by category, brand or title
2. Check off the products you are interested in
3. Go to State, check _enable_ and confirm

You can do the same to pause, change the budget or target ACoS etc..

## Negative keywords to multiple products

![Bulk operations negative](/images/bulk-operations/negative.gif)

1. Choose products by category, brand or title
2. Check off the products you are interested in
3. Go to Negative keywords, paste keywords and confirm

This is useful if you have a product line identified by the title or category leaf and want to exclude traffic from slightly similar but irrelevant products.

**Did you make a mistake?**

Don't worry, if you go to _Bulk Operations > Negative Targeting > Remove negative keywords (rollback)_ and enter keywords then they are removed from campaign groups.
