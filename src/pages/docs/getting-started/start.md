In Advigator, products and campaigns are grouped together in a "Campaign Group." 
You manage activation, budget, and keywords at the group level, and Advigator will replicate operations on individual sub campaigns. 

By default, variations of a product are grouped in the same "Campaign Group." You can change this setting, but it is the recommended one in most cases.

## Start campaign group

To start a campaign group, simply enter a daily budget, choose an ACoS target, and click active.

Then check off the types of sub-campaigns you want to activate. For Sponsored Brand and Sponsored Brand Video you will be asked to upload a custom image and video.

The budget you choose at the product group level will then be dynamically distributed by Advigator into the sub-campaigns (Sponsored Products, Sponsored Display, Sponsored Brand and Sponsored Brand Video). 

Done. Within 5-10 minutes Advigator will take care of creating the sub campaigns in your {% amazon-console /%}   in a new portfolio called Advigator.

{% callout type="warning" title="Pause any existing campaign in Amazon Ads Console" %}
Advigator does not manage your existing campaigns but analyzes their historical data to create new, optimized campaigns. To avoid overlap and allow ours to receive traffic, pause any campaigns in your {% amazon-console /%}   that advertise the same group products. 

If you don't feel comfortable closing your campaigns immediately, then reduce their daily budget.
