## Select a custom image

Here you will be able to see lifestyle images uploaded from "Amazon Creative Assets." 
You can add new images by going to {% amazon-console /%} and save them as "Lifestyle images" or by clicking on "Upload a new file." in Advigator.

Click "Skip custom image" if you want to proceed without a custom image.

## Logo, headline and ASIN

Select a logo, enter an headline and choose up to 3 products to show. 
If you chose a custom image then you can also choose no asin. 

The headline should be relevant with the product and image, and not use pressuring language ([Amazon Ads policy](https://advertising.amazon.com/resources/ad-policy/en/creative-acceptance#overview)).

No ideas for headline? {% chrome-extension /%} and get inspiration from other similar products.
