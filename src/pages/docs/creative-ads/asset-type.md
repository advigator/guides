You can upload images, logos and videos from Advigator or by going to {% amazon-console /%} > Creative Assets. 
If you choose to upload from Amazon Ad Console be careful to properly label images for Sponsored Brand / Display campaigns as **lifestyle** while logos as **Logo**. Otherwise you may mistakenly see the images in the logos section.
