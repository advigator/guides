title: No checkbox for Sponsored Brand (SB)
---

You must have a brand enrolled to Brand registry for at least 2 weeks. 

If you don't have a published brand store then you may not be able to see the checkboxes to activate display and video campaigns. Even if you have already created Display or Video campaigns before.

This is caused by technical bug on the Amazon side that you can fix by doing these two things:

## Create and publish a brand store
You need to have a brand store and make sure it is linked under the title. If it is not, then open a case on Amazon asking to link the brand store (LBR node) below the product title.

## Submit an Ads Console support ticket
    1. Go to [https://advertising.amazon.com/contactus](https://advertising.amazon.com/contactus)
    2. Send a ticket with the following message: "I'm a seller with a registered brand in Brand Registry; however, I don't have access to the store builder, nor access to create SB or SD campaigns. 
  Could you please help correct my brand configuration and adding the missing LBR nodes?"


**Still no seeing checkboxes?**

If after doing these 2 actions you still don't see the checkboxes to activate the campaigns then contact our support by attaching 1) the response to the two Amazon tickets 2) Link to the brand store.
