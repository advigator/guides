title: No checkbox for Sponsored Brand (SB)
---

You must have a brand enrolled to Brand registry for at least 2 weeks. 

If you don't have a published brand store then you may not be able to see the checkboxes to activate display and video campaigns. Even if you have already created Display or Video campaigns before.

This is caused by technical bug on the Amazon side that you can fix by doing these two things:

## Submit an Ads Console support ticket
  1. Go to [https://advertising.amazon.com/contactus](https://advertising.amazon.com/contactus)
  2. Send a ticket with the following message: 
  
  I'm a seller with a registered brand in Brand Registry; however, I am not able to get my brand through GET /brands. The root cause is that the brand is missing a LBR node, please help create a LBR node for this brand.

  If the operator has not figured out what to do then proceed with the alternative method.


## Create and publish a brand store
1. Create an [Amazon storefront](https://advertising.amazon.com/solutions/products/stores)
2. Publish it
3. Verify that it is linked under the title of your product

**Still no seeing checkboxes?**

If after doing these 2 actions you still don't see the checkboxes to activate the campaigns then contact our support by attaching 1) the response to the two Amazon tickets 2) Link to the brand store.
