title: New design guide
---

In February 2023 we redesigned the user interface (UI). Here is a guide of main changes:

## Campaigns

In campaigns you can change the name of the campaigns shown in Amazon and how the daily budget of the campaign group is distributed to the sub campaigns. 
By default it is "Auto" which means it is efficiently distributed to minimize time out of budget. You may want to change it rarely and the default settings should be fine in most cases.

## Products

Under "SKUs" you used to see the list of sponsored ASINs in the group. 
We moved it under the product image because it was confusing to many users to see only a variant image. It wasn't clear it's a product group. The shown image is selected randomly among all products. 
This is also rare that need to be changed. You can keep all products active. Products without inventory or ineligible do not generate traffic even if you leave them active.

## Sync catalog

This action is for importing and updating the catalog. You should use it after you add a new product or make major changes to parent-child relationships or categories. 
It has been moved under Settings > Imports products.

## Creative Ads

The link to create or edit a creative now appears below the activation checkbox. For example, if you activate "Sponsored Brand" or "Sponsored Display" you will see "edit creative" to upload a new image or replace a previous one.
