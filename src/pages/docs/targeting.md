Targeting contains the keywords and product pages of competitors selected by Advigator on which your products will be sponsored. 

The targeting is shared across sub-campaigns (Sponsored Products, Sponsored Display, Sponsored Brand and Sponsored Brand Video). So if you want to add or remove a keyword you only need to do it once.

## Negative targeting
Negative targeting contains keywords and competitor product pages where you do not want your product to appear. 
You can use it to exclude keywords from which you do not want to receive traffic because they are irrelevant or misleading with the product you sell.

### Negative keywords
Any word or keyword can be excluded in exact match or phrase.

- **Phrase match (Recommended)**: Excludes all present and future search terms that contain this word within. For example, if you exclude "iphone" then you will not appear from search terms such as "iphone cover," "iphone glass," "iphone charger," etc. 
    - If you tick "also exclude ASINs" then all competing products that have this word within their title will also be excluded.

- **Exact match**: It only excludes consumers who search for exactly this word. For example, if you exclude "iphone," you will continue to appear for those who search for "iphone covers" but not those who search exactly for "iphone."

### Negative Product pages
You can exclude traffic from competitor product pages by excluding only the specific product, all brand products, or you can exclude the entire leaf category (browse node). 
Keep in mind that sometimes users may be interested in your product coming from a complementary or accessory product from other categories.

## Add new keywords

You can add new keywords in addition to those in Targeting by going to Targeting > custom.

![Custom keywords](/images/targeting/custom.png)

Then enter your keywords one per line

![Custom keywords](/images/targeting/custom-keywords.png)

{% callout type="warning" title="Less is better" %}
Do not copy-paste hundreds of keywords generated by other software because it could reduce the click-through rate (CTR%).
{% /callout %}

## Change bids
You can enter a new keyword with a fixed bid or change the bid of an existing keyword in Targeting by entering it as custom.

If you leave it blank, Advigator sets the optimal bid, otherwise you choose a value. 
If you want to remove a certain match or format for only one keyword then set the bid to $0.02 (or the minimum in your marketplace and ad format).

![Custom keywords](/images/targeting/custom-keywords-bid.png)


{% callout type="warning" title="Set bids carefully" %}
Bids per click set by you are not changed by Advigator. So if we see that a keyword generates a lot of clicks but no orders (or high ACoS), we do not reduce its bid per click. 
{% /callout %}

## Targeting size

This option changes the criteria by which Advigator filters existing campaign data (Advigator and non-Adigator) to select the most relevant keywords/product pages for Targeting.
It is the same process you would do by hand when [analyzing the search terms](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=amazon+analyze+search+term+reports) report with excel.

![Targeting size](/images/targeting/strategy.png)

If a new search term has generated an order then it will always automatically be entered into targeting and all sub campaigns. Based on how many orders and clicks it received then it will have an optimal bid per click. 

If you choose the "Balanced" option then search terms that have had 0 orders so far but have a higher than average CTR% are also included. This is the default option and the one recommended in most cases. 

If you choose "No Filter" then all search terms that have resulted in clicks in the past without performing any relevance checks are included. This option is risky because you might have a lot of keywords. It might make sense if the product has no historical data and you want to grow targeting quickly. 

## Singular, plurals and stop words

Keywords in singular, plural, with stopwords or small variations (hyphens, periods etc..) are considered by Amazon to be identical even in exact match. Therefore if you already see the keyword present in Targeting you do not need to add the other variations as custom. 

In Advigator, we aggregate the data of all possible variations (singular, plural etc..) to calculate conversion rates and enter only one keyword (the variation with the most traffic). 

For example, if in the past the campaign had the singular version, and now the plural one has more traffic, you might see the previous one paused and the plural one activated. Same thing with prepositions, conjunctions etc..
So if in Amazon Ads Console you see that a keyword with orders has been paused, you should find a similar one enabled. It makes no difference in terms of performance.

## Settings

### Match type

All keywords in targeting are adds in the campaigns in all matches: exact, phrase, broad. 
Bids are staggered downward. So phrase matching has a lower bid than exact, and broad lower than exact. Thanks to this technique, it is not necessary to do strategies such as "keyword isolation" in which the phrase match is entered and the exact is added as a negative. 

If for what reason you don't want to have phrase or broad matches then uncheck from Targeting > Settings > match types.

### Dynamic expression and keyword research

You can optionally choose these strategies to search for new keywords and competing products

![Targeting settings scraping](/images/targeting/scraping.png)

- Amazon web scraping: It is an algorithm made by Advigator that analyzes the most used keywords in the leaf category and competitor products. It allows you to have data in Targeting to start from without having to do keyword research. Even if the product is new and without historical data.

- Expensive: This creates a new adgroup within the campaign that uses an automatic expression to make your product appear over competing products (same browse node) that have a higher selling price than your product.

- No prime shipping eligible: This creates a new adgroup within the campaign that uses an automatic expression to make your product appear over competing products (same browse node) that are not eligible for Amazon Prime. 

### Import from other campaigns

Advigator automatically pulls historical data from all campaigns in your account that exclusively sponsor group products. 

For example, if the campaigns group promote products A, B, C then we read data from all campaigns whose ad groups promote no more than A,B,C. If an adgroup promotes A,B,C,**D** then it is not taken into account because **D** is an ASIN not in the campaigns group. 

However, if you are absolutely certain that this campaign promotes an identical product (e.g., the previous version that changed the parent asin) then you can manually tell it to read its historical data.
