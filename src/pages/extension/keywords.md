## Search rank

This is the position of this product in the keyword search results. A value of 1 means that the product comes out in the first position for this keyword. Low values mean that the term is very relevant.

### Found in title / bullets / description

A good SEO practice is to make sure that relevant words are also included on the product page. Not all keywords need to be on the page. For example, competing brands cannot be included in your title. Therefore analyze all keywords one by one.
