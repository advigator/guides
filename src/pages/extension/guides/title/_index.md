The product title has the goal of winning clicks from search results and providing the main information about the product. It impacts click-through rate (CTR) and conversion rate.

Amazon official guidelines allow up to 200 characters, but it's recommend staying under 80-150 characters because it’s easier to read. You don't want to annoy the customers with a wall of text that makes them leave the page.

## Keywords

Keywords present in the title must be highly relevant and specific to your product. If you have a running campaign with Advigator we recommend going to the targeting section and copying the top 3-4 keywords by order. Those keywords are the most customer search term used to find and buy your product, so we assure you they are highly relevant and specific. 
Don’t stuff keywords randomly in your title, but use a template like this:

BRAND NAME - TOP CUSTOMER SEARCH TERMS - FEATURES/USE CASE - (VARIATION NAME)

- Make sure to do not to repeat the same word multiple times
- Try to read your title loudly. It should make sense for a human, not a machine.
- Be concise. Tell more with fewer words.
- Add variation names (color, size, length, etc.) in the end and in round brackets, so they are easier to read. All variations should have the same title but differ only from these last words at the end. For example, i) TITLE (Black, S), TITLE (White, L), TITLE (Orange, XL).
Adding variation in the title will increase the likelihood that Amazon selects the correct ASIN when showing search results.

## Truncation on mobile

When your customer is searching from mobile, they should be able to read your full title.  
If truncated, it forces the customer to click to read more. Then clicking back if not what it was looking for. 

A lot of clicks/sessions without sales will lower the conversion rate and increase ACoS.
Some users do not even spend time clicking to read more, and they could scroll to other results. Thus making your click-through rate (CTR) worse.

Here below, the first result contains all information needed within two lines. It’s likely that it has a higher CTR than the 2nd result. So it might have got a better position with a lower bid per click.
